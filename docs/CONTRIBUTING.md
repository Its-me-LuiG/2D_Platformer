# Contributing to Pixel Platformer

Thank you for considering contributing to our 2D platformer game! This document provides guidelines and instructions for contributing to the project.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** to your local machine
3. **Set up the development environment** by following the instructions in the README.md

## Development Workflow

### Branching Strategy

- `main` branch is for stable, production-ready code
- Create feature branches from `main` using the naming convention `feature/your-feature-name`
- Create bug fix branches using the naming convention `bugfix/issue-description`

### Making Changes

1. **Create a new branch** for your feature or bug fix
2. **Make your changes** in your branch
3. **Test your changes** thoroughly
4. **Commit your changes** with clear, descriptive commit messages
5. **Push your branch** to your fork on GitHub
6. **Create a Pull Request** to the main repository

## Commit Message Guidelines

Good commit messages help with project maintenance. Please follow these guidelines:

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

Example:
```
Add coin collection animation

- Add sparkle effect when collecting coins
- Increase score display visibility
- Fixes #42
```

## Code Style

- Use consistent indentation (2 or 4 spaces)
- Follow the existing code style in the project
- Comment your code where necessary
- Keep functions small and focused on a single task

## Adding New Features

When adding new features:

1. **Discuss the feature** first by creating an issue
2. **Design the feature** with consideration for the existing codebase
3. **Document the feature** in code comments and update the README if necessary
4. **Test the feature** thoroughly before submitting a pull request

## Asset Creation

When creating or modifying pixel art assets:

1. Keep a consistent style with existing assets
2. Use the same scale and color palette
3. Test assets in-game to ensure they look good in context
4. Document any new asset creation functions

## Questions?

If you have any questions or need help, please:

1. Check the existing issues on GitHub
2. Create a new issue if your question hasn't been addressed
3. Reach out to the project maintainers

Thank you for contributing!
